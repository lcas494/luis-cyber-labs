# Metasploitable Vulnerability Assessment Lab

## Overview

This lab involved using Kali Linux to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the intentionally vulnerable Metasploitable 2 virtual machine. The goal was to simulate a basic penetration test workflow, covering information gathering, password cracking, and privilege escalation.

---

## Objectives

- Set up a secure, isolated lab environment using VirtualBox
- Identify open ports and services using `nmap`
- Extract password hashes from the Metasploitable system
- Crack the hashes using John the Ripper and the `rockyou.txt` wordlist
- Access the FTP server and simulate post-exploitation
- Learn the basics of privilege escalation and system enumeration

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Kali Linux** (Attacker machine)
- **Metasploitable 2** (Target machine)
- `nmap`
- `unshadow`
- `john` (John the Ripper)
- `rockyou.txt` wordlist
- `ftp` (Linux built-in FTP client)

---

## Key Steps Performed

1. **Network Configuration**
   - Configured both VMs to use the *Internal Network* adapter in VirtualBox for isolation.
   - Verified IP address communication between Kali and Metasploitable.

2. **Scanning & Enumeration**
   - Performed a service scan using:
     ```
     nmap -sV <target-ip>
     ```
   - Identified services like FTP, SSH, and vulnerable web apps running on the target.

3. **Extracting Hashes**
   - Located `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files in Metasploitable.
   - Used `unshadow` to combine them into a format readable by John:
     ```
     unshadow passwd shadow > unshadowed.txt
     ```

4. **Password Cracking**
   - Used John the Ripper with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist:
     ```
     john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt unshadowed.txt
     ```

5. **FTP Access**
   - Logged into the FTP server using recovered credentials.
   - Demonstrated access to sensitive files.

6. **Post-Exploitation Awareness**
   - Noted that root access was already present.
   - Recognized the risks of weak passwords and exposed services.

## Challenges Faced

- Initially forgot to decompress the `rockyou.txt.gz` file.
- Encountered uncrackable hashes (e.g., for the `root` user), demonstrating realistic limitations of dictionary attacks.
- Needed to clarify whether actions should be done from Kali or Metasploitable at various stages.
- Understood the difference between login shells, privilege levels, and ethical usage of tools.

## What I Learned

- How password hashing and cracking works using shadow files and John the Ripper
- The importance of securing network services like FTP
- How attackers pivot from weak credentials to full access
- The value of structured documentation and reporting in cybersecurity


---

## Next Steps

- Revisit the lab and explore more services (like vulnerable web apps)
- Try automated tools like `hydra` for brute-forcing
- Implement a simulated patching exercise to "fix" the vulnerabilities

## Permission

This lab was conducted in a secure, offline environment for educational purposes only.
