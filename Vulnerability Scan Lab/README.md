# OpenVAS Vulnerability Scanning Lab – Cybersecurity Home Lab Project

## Overview  
In this lab, I performed a clean installation and configuration of Greenbone’s OpenVAS Community Edition on Kali Linux. The goal was to simulate a real-world vulnerability scanning workflow using a dedicated vulnerability scanner in a virtualized lab environment. This setup serves as a foundational exercise in vulnerability management and network security assessment.

## Objectives  
- Reinstall and configure OpenVAS (GVM) Community Edition  
- Troubleshoot service, socket, and database issues  
- Perform full vulnerability scans against a test subnet  
- Analyze scan results for detection coverage and accuracy  

## Lab Setup  

### Environment  
- **Host Machine:** VirtualBox  
- **OS:** Kali Linux (latest updates applied)  
- **Targets:** Metasploitable 2, Kali Linux, and other local VMs  
- **Network Setup:**  
  - NAT Adapter (for initial setup and package updates)  
  - Internal Network (`intnet`) for isolated scanning

## Configuration Steps  
1. Performed `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` to resolve potential missing dependencies  
2. Cleanly reinstalled OpenVAS and GVM packages  
3. Ran `sudo gvm-setup` to initialize GVM components  
4. Used `gvm-check-setup` to validate installation and identify missing data  
5. Synced missing feeds using:
   - `sudo greenbone-feed-sync --type scap`  
6. Verified services were running properly:
   - `gvmd`  
   - `ospd-openvas`  
7. Confirmed socket file permissions and GMP compatibility  
8. Created and launched a full vulnerability scan against the internal lab subnet  
9. Validated scan config availability (e.g., Full and Fast)

## Challenges Faced  
- PID file and socket access issues with `gvmd`  
- Broken GMP compatibility and missing scanner version errors  
- Failed XML command execution due to outdated `gvm-cli` usage  
- Incomplete scan config population due to failed feed sync  
- _gvm user permissions and limited sudo access caused operational delays  

## Outcome  
- Successfully completed a full scan using "Full and Fast" profile  
- Discovered and confirmed partial vulnerabilities on Metasploitable 2  
- Learned how OpenVAS integrates with `ospd-openvas`, Redis, and PostgreSQL  
- Gained experience with systemd, socket permissions, and scan tuning  

## Future Enhancements  
- Explore creating custom scan configurations  
- Integrate email alerting and scan scheduling  
- Expand target variety to include Windows hosts and web apps  
- Consider pairing OpenVAS with a SIEM like Wazuh for correlation
