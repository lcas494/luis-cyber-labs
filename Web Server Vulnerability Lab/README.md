# Web Server & DVWA Vulnerability Lab

## Overview

This lab focuses on setting up a basic Apache web server on Ubuntu and deploying DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) to simulate a vulnerable web environment. Using Kali Linux, a vulnerability assessment was conducted using Nikto to identify security misconfigurations and exposures within the web application and server.

## Objective

- Deploy a vulnerable web application (DVWA) on Apache.
- Scan the application for vulnerabilities using Nikto.
- Analyze and interpret scan results.
- Gain experience with web server misconfigurations and insecure coding practices.

## Tools & Technologies

- Ubuntu Server 22.04.5
- Apache2 Web Server
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- Kali Linux
- Nikto
- VirtualBox (with NAT and Internal Network adapters)

## Network Topology
Kalo Linux and Ubuntu Web Server(Apache2 +DVWA)
## Lab Setup & Configuration

1. **Set Up Apache2 on Ubuntu Server**
   - Installed using `sudo apt install apache2`.
   - Verified by visiting the serverâ€™s IP in the browser.

2. **Deploy DVWA**
   - Cloned DVWA into `/var/www/html`.
   - Set proper file permissions.
   - Copied and renamed the sample configuration file:  
     `cp config/config.inc.php.dist config/config.inc.php`

3. **Start DVWA**
   - Accessed DVWA through `http://<server-ip>/dvwa`.
   - Created the database and completed setup via the web UI.

4. **Run Nikto Scan from Kali**
   - Used Nikto to perform a web vulnerability scan:
     ```
     nikto -h http://<target-ip> -o dvwa_scan.txt
     ```
   - Saved the output to `dvwa_scan.txt`.

## Vulnerabilities Identified (via Nikto)

- **Missing HTTP Headers:**
  - `X-Frame-Options` (Clickjacking protection)
  - `X-Content-Type-Options` (MIME sniffing protection)

- **Directory Indexing Enabled:**
  - Root directory and sub-paths exposed
  - Risk of exposing sensitive files

- **Outdated Apache Version:**
  - Apache/2.4.52 flagged as outdated and potentially vulnerable

- **Excessive HTTP Methods Allowed:**
  - GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD were available

- **Known CVEs Identified:**
  - Apache 1.3 and Web Publisher vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-1999-0269)

## Lessons Learned

- Vulnerability scanners like Nikto are useful for quick assessments of web server security.
- Default web server settings (like directory indexing) can introduce major risks.
- Headers play an essential role in modern web application security.
- Even simple misconfigurations can expose systems to attacks.

## Future Improvements

- Add security headers in Apache configuration.
- Disable unnecessary HTTP methods.
- Upgrade to the latest Apache version.
- Use additional tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP for deeper analysis.
