# luis-cyber-labs
Hello! My name is Luis and I am currently a Cybersecurity student at WGU. As I go through the course work I have been doing labs to continue to explore what I have learned.
My goal with these labs is to expand my knowledge past the theoretical and build a practical skillset to further my understanding in cybersecurity, networking, opperating systems, and cloud.
